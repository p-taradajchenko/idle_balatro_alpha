I need to refactor this into a scalable React application structure.Please perform the following:Create a components folder.Extract the Card UI into components/PlayingCard.jsx.Extract the evaluateHand logic into a utility file utils/pokerLogic.js.Create a hooks folder and extract the game loop (setInterval) and state management into a custom hook named useGameEngine.Keep the UI logic in App.jsx but import the components.Refer to project_spec.md for the desired data structures."Phase 3: PersistencePrompt:"Currently, the game resets on refresh.
